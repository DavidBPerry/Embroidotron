# Embroidotron
The Embroidotron is designed to convert any standard sewing machine into a computer controlled embroidery machine. Our goal is to make machine embroidery more accessible, hackable, and fun. This repository serves as a source for the software, CAD documents and sample design files required to perform the modification.
