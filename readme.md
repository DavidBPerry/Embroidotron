# Embroidotron
The Embroidotron is designed to convert any standard sewing machine into a computer controlled embroidery machine. Our goal is to make machine embroidery more accessible, hackable, and fun. This repository serves as a source for the software, CAD designs and examples for running the Embroidotron.

This project was developed as a team in CMU's Electromechanical Systems Design Class and carried forward with support from [The Carnegie Mellon Textiles Lab](https://textiles-lab.github.io/). This project was conceived of by the team: Amy Santoso, Amos Fishman-Resheff, David Perry, Juan Luis Vasquez, and Yuree Chu. David Perry has carried this project forward with support from the initial team.

## Contents

 - **Embroidotron_PEmbroider_Integration** 
Demos the integration of the Embroidotron and [PEmbroider](https://github.com/CreativeInquiry/PEmbroider), an open library for computational embroidery with [Processing](http://processing.org/).
 - **Embroidotron_LiveStitch_Keypressed**
Demos the "live stitch mode" in which the user can drive the stitch path using the arrow keys.
 - **arduino_MotorControl**
 The firmware on the arduino which coordinates the needle, computer, and stepper motors.

## Manuals
See the [Embroidotron Manual](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQDnrs32w4o7STt2GDkAjPlq3Xo2kj3-9yWwGp2af6CuQFf4LI4kpUE5b-No-ILSyXCkttRJLsAB5MZ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) for instructions on setting up hardware and running your first job.
